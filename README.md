# Paper Laptop

With the growing number of affordable single board computers, cheaper LCD panels and generally decreasing prices of electronic components we've seen a growing number of projects focusing on building laptops and tablets. Most involve using 3D printed ABS for a prototype and running some sort of fund raising project to create injection molded versions. These projects are very cool.

On the other hand I keep wondering how easy can we make it to just build your own.  There are some affordable supplies like paper, cardboard and fiber board available that require minimal tooling so I started thinking about building my own laptop using paper products (or as much as I could get away with).

## Materials

+ cardboard

## Software

 + [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) - because it is free and it made general sense to my tired brain
